# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My GitHub! 

## ðŸš€ About Me 
Hi, I'm Amy, a **Chemical Engineer** with a passion for **data science, computational chemistry, and AI-driven drug discovery**. My background in Chemistry and Chemical Engineering has evolved into a focus on leveraging **Python, machine learning, and data analytics** to solve real-world problems in science and engineering.

## ðŸ“‚ Featured Projects
### ðŸ”¹ [Machine learning model predicting effective drugs against Acetylcholinesterase] - *(Drug Discovery AI Model)*
- Developed a machine learning model to predict bioactivity of drug-like molecules  
- Used cheMBL database to search for available data of bioactivity using IC50 against Acetylcholinesterase.
- Pre-processed data and obtained descriptors using RDkit.
- Create and evaluated various models using LazyPredict and Scikit-Learn.
- Built a GUI letting users search a molecule and get a predicted of whether it is effective against Acetylcholinesterase.
